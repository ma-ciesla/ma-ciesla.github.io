Here, he collaborated with Drs. Katarzyna Jankowiak and  Efthymia Kapnoual comparing neural responses to orthographic and image referents on early-stage second language acquisition. Currently, Mathew is working toward his Ph.D. as a postgraduate researcher at the Department of Psychology, Northumbria University Newcastle.
